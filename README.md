# Clipboard-Manager
Simple Clipboard manager app to practsie my kotlin skills
The application listens for background clipboard changes and saves the content locally.

# Why This?
Think of a busy person, visiting many sites daily, hourly. You would want to place all copied text/links in one central place for easy 
reference or reuse. 
Think of it as a Clipboard 'Cart'

# Functionality
Steps:
1. Data is copied and saved locally
2. Displayed in a recyclerView
3. Copies a selected ItemView text to clipboard ,index[0], when clicked.
4. ItemView data can be shared to other apps

## TODO

1. Clipboard Listener(Listen for clipboard data saved in background) - Service
2. Custom UI.(Customize UI/UX to popularize the app to users) - Daily usage
3. Ads - Revenue stream
4. Notifications with offline activity - Increases interactivity
